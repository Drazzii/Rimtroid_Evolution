        <description>[PAWN_nameDef] spent a considerable amount of time on Metroid ranches, and knows how to properly handle nearly any of them. [PAWN_pronoun] has a higher chance of training and taming metroids, and metroid operations done by them will never result in defects.</description>

<!--OTHER TRAITS

    "Metroid Injection" - the pawn has taken an injection that supplied weak metroid cells. These cells do not provide large bonuses, but will also not require a dedicated suit, and avoid most of the downsides. Provides slightly higher heat resistance and regeneration, with slightly lower cold resistance. Injections fade after two years; new injections are optional, and not having another one has no future downsides.
    "Metroid Infusion" - the pawn is half metroid, giving them the strengths and weaknesses of metroids to a very high degree. However they also require an undersuit to sustain them on the planet, which is integrated with their body.
    "Metroid Lover" - loves having metroids around, and will gain a mood boost for ones being around.
