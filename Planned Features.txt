====================
NEXT UPDATE FEATURES
====================
(Top features are the most important; bottom feature are for later, or if they can be fit in)


===============
IMMEDIATE ADDITIONS:
===============
	-ENERGY EXTRACT: An early-game gel that can be extracted from corpses. Used to make nutrient solutions, fill energy lanterns, and acts as an early game food source for metroids. Always expires after three days, regardless of temperature.
	-ENERGY LANTERN: Rename current lantern to Energy Pylon. Energy Lanterns are similar, but they must be fueled and can only feed younger metroids.
	-Food bar does not go down when a metroid is resting.
	-Metroids heal from malnutrition 200% faster.
	-Age comp must be removed and re-added after each evolution.
	-Metroids that reach next evolution must be given 100% food.
	-Metroids should not vomit or recieve the sand/gravel/dirt attack.
	-Metroids should feed on prisoners without the prisoners getting angry.
	-Wild metroids shouldn't attack other metroids.
	
	-Alpha Metroids bombs must be designated to be placed on a spot.






===============
UI:
===============
	-Add mod options:
		-Metroids can spawn in the wild
		-Queens can be acquired
		-Queen event can be enabled
		-Fire spreading
		-Metroids can berserk
		-Chance to untame when berserk
		-Age gained when landing hits
	-Add text that lets players know years until next stage


===============
ABILITIES:
	-LIFE DRAIN (Larva): Latches onto a target and applies the life drain sickness, alongside rapidly gaining food and age.

	-ELECTRIC BEAM (Gamma): A beam attack that does extreme damage to a single target.
	
	-POUNCE (Zeta): An immediate jump to a designated location. Short range; does damage when used on a pawn. 
	-FIRE BREATH (Zeta): A spew of fire that toasts anything in front of the Zeta. Short range, high damage. Will be added later.
	
	-ACID VOLLEY (Zeta): An attack that fires electrically-charged acid in a cone shape.

	-LEAP (Omega): A medium-ranged jump that does high damage, stun, and even knockback, to a selected target.
	-FIRE BREATH (Omega): A spew of fire that does massive damage to a single target.
	-FIRE VOLLEY (Omega): Launches 3 fireballs at a target. These fireballs explode, dealing massive damage.
	-FIRE SWEEP: Omega sweeps the area in front of him with a powerful laser, in a cone-like pattern.
	-TAIL SLAM (Omega): Consecutive slams against the ground, shaking and likely stunning anything nearby.
	
===============


===============
MECHANICS:

	-LOCAL NESTING: Certain metroids will have a togglable gizmo that says "Nesting enabled" (which is disabled by default). When enabled metroids will attempt to find an ideal area, and begin covering the area in webbing. Once webbing reaches a certain point, it will be considered a 'nest', where faction metroids will reside unless directed otherwise. Metroids can be directed to return here at any point, and Gamma metroids may create natural tunnels that lead here. These tunnels can later be used for metroids to quickly return to the nest. Nests are beneficial for groups of metroids.
		-Less chance of berserking (-10%)
		-Increased healing rate
		-Faster web growth
		-Regulated temperature
		-Wild metroids have a small chance at joining the colony willingly (which players can deny).
		
	The only downside is the nests will often be covered with thick webbing, which is slow for colonists to move through. Once a nest is established, A popup will appear on the screen, notifying the player and recommending them to enclose it. If needed, the player can designate an area named "Metroid Nest" that dictates where the nest can be made, otherwise it will be an area by rocky walls, or a cave area. Nests can be disabled through mod options. This will be a hidden feature, and will not be hinted at.

===============
ITEMS:
===============
	-AEION EXTRACT: A rare item used in the creation of metroid serums. Sold by exotic traders. (Evolution)
	
	-Lower Metroid chitin price
		

===============
GENETICS:
===============
	
	-NUTRIENT SOLUTION: An injection that fills up the food of a pawn, and slows down hunger rate for a period of time. Ideal for downed metroids, or metroids incapable of eating themselves. Made at Neurobench.
	
	-BIOMETRIC INHIBITOR: An implant that completely eliminates berserking chance, in exchange for a high likelyhood of stunting and possibly decay later in time.

	-THERMOGENIC IMPLANT: An implant that increases the overall body temperature of a metroid, and thus allows Metroids to survive 'normal' low temperatures. These temperatures are around what a human can endure.
	
	-SYSTEMIC STRENGTHENING: Increases the lowered stats of larvae and Bantees to 100%. Works especially well for stunted metroids. Done within a biotank or by serum.

	-Dull Teeth/Claws: Unsharpens the teeth and claws of metroids, making them do only 1 damage. Does not transfer between stages due to growth patterns, and will need to be redone every so often. Does not prevent abilities from being used.



===============
WEAPONS:
===============
	-HYPODERMIC RIFLE: An extremely long-range rifle that is specially designed to pierce through metroid shells, delivering a variety of injections. By default, it is used for downing wild metroids, pacifying berserk metroids, and feeding metroids from a distance.
	

	-FROST DAMAGE: A damage type that inflicts frost damage, which is based on cold, and some ballistic damage. Frost damage depends on cold resistance; if targets don't have it defined, a protection rating of 0 is used. Forst damage does little physical damage, but does slow down targets, inflict hypothermia, and has a chance to give frostbite. It is particularly effective against metroids; while most other beings will generally be slowed and take a lot of hits before death, metroids can die quickly to the damage type. (RT_Core)
	
	


===============
GRAPHICS:
===============

	-Better laser graphics for fire beams.
	-Better graphics for electric floor
	-Atlas textures for gamma metroid webbing.
	
===============
MISC:
===============

	-Most metroids have a 'mutated' state that changes their appearance, and gives their attacks an orange coloring. These attacks do more damage. The idea is to 'mutate' any metroids within a containment unit by exposing them to Aeion, giving them more lethal attacks in exchange for a 100% chance of stunting, and a small chance of cellular decay. Metroids that are mutated lose some - or all - of the abilities they had before. Evolved metroids also have a different appearance, including glowing eyes, a mossy overlay.

	-Metroids that make webbing should create a webbing tile that is harvested, instead of the raw resources. This webbing is thick and extremely slow to go through (except for metroids, which have a higher movement speed on it), but can be deconstructed to give the product. Once this is added, all metroids above Gamma will produce the webbing.

	-CELLULAR DECAY: A permanent defect that specifically occurs in metroids that have been artificially modified. Metroids will slowly 'dissolve' when left untreated. Extremely low chance from stunting, and higher with more drastic changes. Some metroids have a chance at developing this every 100 years.

	-CELLULAR BREAKDOWN: The same effect of Ceullular Decay, but is done when forcefully drained of energy.

	-FERAL: A defect that permanently turns a metroid manhunter, eliminating the possiblity for any sort of taming.
	
	-ACCELERATED DIVISION: A double-edged condition that increases age speed and natural regen factors, at a cost of more food needed.
	
	-Add a use for the energy-draining purple liquid in Samus Returns. Can be used in biotanks.


===============
CODING:
===============

	-Older metroids should not spawn on starting map.
	
	-Metroid food bar doesn't go down during combat, or during sleep.
	
	-Metroids have passive regeneration when outside of combat.
	
	-Metroids should not need much sleep.
	
	-Bantees and larvae should not drop chitin. (completed)

	-Metroid food converts into age AFTER combat, with the food amount being tracked in a hediff during combat. Once combat has ended the metroid will temporarily stand still and 'process' the food, which will tick up the age rate. Similar to how metroids act in the Prime series, when they are detached from the player or another being.
	
	-Metroids will not hunt each other down for food, unless they are opposing factions. Alternatively, most Metroids are automatically added into a faction once they reach a certain age. There is a small chance rogue metroids will appear, which won't be a part of any faction.
	
	-Metroids have considerable slowdown in cold temperatures, if they don't have genetic modification that allows them to survive in cold temperatures.
	
	-Metroid body parts should regrow after a certain amount of time.
	
	-Metroids spawned by a queen should have automatic manhunter.
	
	-Metroids completely freeze up in cold temperatures they cannot stand, rather than complete hypothermia.

====================
SECONDARY FEATURES
====================
All the features below would be nice to add in, but aren't top priority for the update.




===============
METROIDS:
===============
	-Tallon Metroid: The base for all Metroid mutations. while not powerful by itself, many metroids are locked behind the Tallon Metroid, and mutations (forced or natural) will need to occur in this stage to acquire them. Acquired by exposing a Metroid larvae to Aeion within a biotank. No abilities.
	
	-Infant Tallon Metroid: The stage before the Tallon metroid. Similar to it, except has a higher chance of mutating properly. No abilities.
	
	-Fission Metroid: A metroid that can divide itself into another type. While divided, both metroids will be one of four random sub-types:
		-Fission Metroid (power): A metroid that is weak only to standard damage.
		-Fission Metroid (fire): A metroid that is weak only to fire.
		-Fission Metroid (cold): A metroid that is weak only to the cold.
		-Fission Metroid (shock): A metroid that is weak only to electrical pulses (i.e. EMP)
		-Fission Metroid (stunted): A normal fision metroid, without being able to seperate.
	All above metroids can be harmed by explosives. Pre-division metroids have the ability to split at at will, but will also split once enough damage is taken. The post-division metroids have this ability, except with a cooldown that takes several days.
	
	-Hunter Metroid: A fast, hardy metroid that can attack extremely quickly at medium ranges. It's ranged ability does not do damage, but instead is capable of inflicting life drain at a frighteningly high rate, alongside drastically slowing a target down. Hunter metroids posess a tether ability, which is a mid-range attack that attaches and slows targets.


===============
PRIME METROID:
===============

	
	-Prime Metroid (?): The penultimate Metroid in existence. Prime Metroids are not found in the wild, cannot be bought, and take extremely specific conditions and dedication to create. Quadrums can go by before one is completed, and that's not counting if any mistakes happen along the way. However the result is well worth the wait, and the additions you can add to it make it a practically unstoppable force.
	
	-Prime Metroids require a perfectly healthy Metroid Larvae, which is then contained within a sealed habitat. This sealed habitat requires power-heavy machines to force it down a specific evolution chain; if power is lost for too long, or they are exposed to the outside environment, the process with fail. It is advisable to start from a Bantee Metroid; the further into the lifestage the larvae is, the lower the chance it'll have to adapt.
	
	-Once the larvae has acquired the proper mutation, it needs to be moved into a genesis chamber, which needs to be kept within the environment. This genesis chamber requires vast amounts of power, fuel, nutrition, and cooling. A chance of failure is always present, but if any area of needs doesn't meet demand, the chances of a failure drastically increase.
	
	-The Prime Metroid takes a total of three quadrums to fully grow. During this time the environment will need to undergo changes; first subjected to high voltage, then to subzero temperatures, then to temperatures that would normally catch anything else on fire. Every so often a message will appear that updates the player on the progress. Once the Prime Metroid is done, it will be wild by default; the player will have to force docility onto it through the artificial environment.
	
	-Once the Prime Metroid is permanently tamed, it is ready for use. The player can decide to further enhance it with additional training, genetic modification, and adding mechanical equipment that gives it new abilities. Genetic modification carries the standard risk of defects.
	
	-Housing a Prime Metroid is seen as a global threat, and many factions will have issues with the player owning one. Entire extermination armies may be sent to get rid of - or even capture - the Prime Metroid.
	
	-Once a Prime Metroid is fully upgraded, it is immortal, can survive any environment, rapidly regenerates wounds, have resistances to nearly any damage types, and has only a single area that can be damaged. It's immune system prevents any sort of external changes, blocking any and all viruses and changes. Only the specialized genetic changes can bypass this effect.
	
		-Power Beam: A beam attack that does normal damage. It has no special properties, but also does more damage than the other breath attacks, and can knock back pawns. Fires up to 3 times.
		-Wave Beam: A beam attack that does a relatively smaller amount of damage, but completely bypasses sheilds and stuns pawns for a long amount of time. Can fry nearby electronics, and EMPs any mechanical device it hits. Fires up to 3 times.
		-Plasma Beam: A beam attack that inflicts severe burn damage. Fires up to 3 times.
		-Ultrafrigid breath: A ranged attack that freezes and inflicts hypothermia on a single target. Can be lethal to pawns not resistant to cold. Fires up to 3 times.
		-Frost Spikes: The metroid smashes the ground, creating a wall of icy spikes that freeze anything caught in it. Can be used regardless of state.
		-Acid Barrage: Fires 3-5 projectiles that create a cloud of acid upon impact.
		
		
		-Missile Barrage: Fires down 4 missiles that do small damage individually, but covers a large area. Must be added manually. Fires up to 3 times. Must be added manually.
		-Snare Beams: A beam that does no damage, but stuns and pulls in a target it attaches to.
		-Wave Projectors: Creates two slow-moving, but damaging, orbs that homing orbs that lock on to enemies. While they can path extremely accurately, they do explode after a set amount of time. Preferrably, these will try to path through solid objects, which dissipates them. These projectors change based on the current 'damage' state. Must be added manually.
	


===============
ITEMS:
===============
	-AEION CORE: A rare item used as a fuel source for certain biotanks. Can be used in the creation of Aeion Extract, but is inneficient.

	-TRITIUM: A stand-in for phazon, since Phazon no longer exists. Found through merchants and within ruins. Large amounts of uranium can also be spent to acquire some. Used for genetic processes and recipes.


===============
GENETICS:
===============
	-CYTOBENCH (?): A new workbench that is specially designed to create unique serums that alter metroid physiology. All serums and medical items have a chance at stunting the metroid, or inflicting another negative side effect.
	
	-XENOME CONTAINMENT UNIT (XCU): The standard containment unit for metroids. They are not very strong, but relatively easy to make. Comes in various sizes, with the biggest one able to support a Zeta Metroid. Can be unpowered, but metroids have a higher chance of breaking out.
	
	-SONIC BARRIER TANK (SBT): An expensive upgrade to the XCU. Relies on constant power to keep it up. Cannot be broken through, and is able to support up to a Zeta.
	
	
	-Hunting Alteration: A medical procedure that eliminates berserking from a metroid, in exchange for stunting and some stat debuffs. Surgery material made at Neurobench.
	
	-Systemic Strengthening: Increases the lowered stats of larvae and Bantees to 100%. Works especially well for stunted metroids. Done within a biotank or by serum.
	
	-Cryo Habitation: A metroid alteration that allows metroids to survive in the cold much better. While they can survive colder temperatures, they still will be affected by hypothermia, and can not survive in subzero temperatures for long. Done within a Biotank. Chance of death for metroid to die during procedure.
	
	-Nutrient Manipulation: Allows certain metroids to eat meat, in exchange for a lowered metabolism and slightly faster hunger rate. Done within a Biotank. Change for metroid to die during procedure.
	
	-Stage Acceleration: Rapidly increases the age of a metroid, progressing the metroid to a desired stage. During this process the metroid is in stasis, and health conditions - and even death - can pop up if the acceleration is too long. Can take multiple days. Done within a Biotank.
	
	-Cloning: Player can kill a tamed metroid in exchange for a template that allows cloning. This template has infinite uses, but clones are likely to have genetic defects, ranging from drastically lower lifespans, to no abilities, to higher berserk rates. Genetic effects may also be positive, and a clone that has many positives and no negatives can be a truly powerful and expensive creature.
