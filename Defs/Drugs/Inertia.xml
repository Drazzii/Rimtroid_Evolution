		<description>Inertia is an injected drug specifically designed to interfere with the unusual Metroid body structure.\nThis drug halts the adaptive growth of metroids, and permanently supresses the mutation potnetial metroids are known for, effictively isolating them into a single form. Metroids injected with this drug will be 'locked' in their current state, aging normally but never growing into another form.\nInertia is essentially a poison to anything else, as it was exclusively designed to work with the cell-like body structure that all Metroid possess.\n Ancient texts refer to Inertia as 'Serum 070-H', and initially contained ingredients that have been substituted over time. Records indicate that it was considered a failed experiment when it was first discovered. Despite this, it is a quite popular and essential compound that allow metroid breeders and traders to thrive in their business.</description>
